    <h1>Welcome to the CAS Authentication Demo using ExpressJS</h1>
    <h3>Click on the link below to demonstrate CAS Authentication</h3>
    <!-- with href -> we move to our desired page 
    Within that page we have a javascript call (we can keep this at the beginning)
    do all our authentication -> prior to showing the page -> then we will get a username
    or some propagated error-->
    <a href="/login/cas">Login with CAS</a></body></br>
    <!-- no need to logout of the app -> not preserving any data -->
    <!--redoes ticket validation -->
    <a href="/logout/app">Log out of the app</a></br>
    <a href="/logout/cas">Log out of the app and end the CAS session</a></br>
</body>
<!--
    This is what we need:
    An unauthenticated page with Login button
    Once logged in -> new page with 2 new buttons (logout of app and logout of cas)
    this would give us redirection back to unauthenticated page with login button
